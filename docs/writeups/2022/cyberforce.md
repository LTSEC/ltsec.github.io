# DoE CyberForce 2022

DoE CyberForce is a hybrid competition run by [Argonne National Laboratory] and sponsored by the [U.S. Department of Energy], featuring a heavy emphasis on network security and digital forensics in the field of Operational Technology (OT).

2022 was the first time Louisiana Tech competed in CyberForce, with the team competing in the event virtually as opposed to on-site in Chicago. Given our previous experience in more Information Technology (IT)-oriented competitions, we were optimistic but also uncertain about what was in store for us.

## Preparation

To put it simply: our preparation for the event was abysmal.

The quarter system does not take kindly to slacking or provide much in the way of downtime, so the time made avaiable to us for event preparation was close to nil.
