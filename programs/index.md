# Programs

LTSEC hosts documentation for projects supported by LTSEC, for use within LTSEC, or created by members of LTSEC. Most notably, we host documentation for programs used within competitions we compete in or help organize.

Note that programs included in this website are not owned by LTSEC or Louisiana Tech University, but rather by the individual contributors of the program. LTSEC hosts documentation as a service for its members.
